The settlement was formed through close ties and close pursuit. Not just housing. Shikshamandir was built. He is the past-story of the development of Vidyatirna in a fallen land. In the vicinity of the Ganges, the ultimate reading center was established in the mud of educational needs. Name Gangapuri Shikshasadan. Established January 2, 1954.The people who came from East Bengal were the benefactors of that work. Education was limited.

                    But Sadh was not stagnant. So the journey of the organization in the seemingly insignificant arrangement. First debut as an unpaid primary school. Gradually secondary, then higher secondary.Located in South Kolkata, the school has a long history. The progress of the school has happened from different leaders at different times. The current infrastructure includes computer rooms, bicycle stands, generators, science buildings, private meeting rooms, adequate classrooms and other arrangements. Manisi-murti placed on the school premises indicates a pleasant atmosphere. In addition to regular reading, sports and cultural aspects are also important. There are many recognitions, certificates and commemorative awards. Jananandita is Saraswat-sadhana.

                    The school has received the title of success due to the achievements of many. There are many alumni who have been inspired by the current students in almost all the continents of the world to move forward in their own style of progress. The light of the past will continue to be the 'lighthouse of feeling' in the days to come.
